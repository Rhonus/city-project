This is a repository for a seminar at the University Hamburg where we learn to use Git and GitHub in order to collaborate via remote with various other people on scientific projects.
there is no Installation instruction because there is nothing to install. its just a bunch of files and directories about a city guide for tourists to know some nice places around Hamburg.
