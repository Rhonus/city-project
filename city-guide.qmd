Places to avoid: 
You should definetly avoid the "Volksparkstadion". I's just bad football over there. And bad beer. And confused people. And ugly music. 

Place to relax (in HH):
I love going for walks in the Altonaer Volkspark because it reminds me of a forest. Sometimes you can walk for 10 minutes without seeing another person. An introvertsÂ´ dream!
